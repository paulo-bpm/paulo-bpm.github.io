        <p> Learning a new language can be inglorious at some moments, but very enjoyable and rewarding at other moments.
            You frequently get to a point where you feel you are not making any progress. Then, suddenly something happens that
            makes us realize how much progress you have made. </p>
        ​
        <p> Along the journey, you alternate between these two perspectives of your own performance. When you are starting fresh,
            when you are a beginner, like little babies, you go from knowing nothing to knowing 10 words. That is just like
            multiplying your vocabulary by infinity. Then, in the first month, you learn forty new words, so now you know 50.
            That is still great: increasing your vocabulary by 400% in one month is amazing! You get very excited and bold. You
            think nothing can hold you to the ground and you are taking off: the sky is the limit! Until something makes us
            realize that this airplane of yours is not going so far, so fast. That happens when you stop looking at what you
            know and look at what you do not yet know. The amount of words you do not know is basically just as huge as it was
            when you started. It feels like trying to move an entire mountain using a bucket and digging with your bare hands. </p>
        
        <p> But you keep going anyways because if other people can do it, you can too! If thousands of babies are learning this
            same language, without even trying to, you think, you can do it too! And you do learn it. You start to be able to
            understand those short stories you did not understand before. That song you had no idea what it was about, you can
            now understand a good deal. You start to think you are doing great again. However, the more you know, the slower
            your progress seems to be. On top of that, there is the fact you are now starting to forget some of the words you
            learned. It was already awfully hard to fill your bucket, but now there is a hole in it!</p>
        
        <p> You ought to keep going, you ought to put more in than the hole is letting out. You have to learn more words than
            you forget. And you do it. you start trying to watch some videos with subtitles, and you listen to some podcasts.
            You can understand a good deal if they do not speak too fast. But – there is always a 'but', a 'however', a
            'nonetheless'… wait, what?! I don’t know this word yet! - you figure out that you should learn how to think in the
            language you are learning. Your brain gets tired very easily when it has to make multiple translations just to have
            a simple conversation. You are getting input in the new language, but you have to translate it, so you can process
            the information in your own language, then translate it back... so on and so forth for every interaction.</p>
        
        <p> Once again, you do it. You start to think using the language you are learning. Wow! Now you can use two different
            languages to think about things. This is just like a whole new world. Before long, though, you realize that if you
            think using the new language, you can just think like a five-year-old child. Your thoughts are not going very far.
            This is a decisive point, I have to tell you. It is very tempting to not think using the language you are learning
            because you feel so very dumb. Still, you do have to think using the new language, because that is what will get
            you to be fluent.</p>
        
        <p> That is not to say that, when you get to what they call fluency, you are over this roller coaster. But you will be
            used to it. At this point, you know that all the downs you went through pushed you to be creative, to try new
            things, and to improve the way you learn. The downs were when you got prepared to go higher. You did not move the
            mountain anywhere, but the view up there is astonishing.</p>
